            <p>Please note that this page is entirely a scam that is trying to steal your data and your kneecaps. This page is legally required to tell you this or else the popo would be after us, but please move along swiftly and dont dwell on this section as it is entirely useless for you purposes. If you want to know more about our buisness practises please read our support page, many atrocities against animal- and human rights have been committed there, don't worry, we did it all in an anarchist enviroment free from laws and regualtions. But if you wish to sue us the same thing that happened on March 12th will happen to you. Don't ask what hapoened. No really don't, unless you wish to be six feet under. Never double cross the pets or the pals, we are armed and dangerous. </p>
