            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>It all began in 2010 with a dream, a llama, and an incident involving a trampoline. Our founder, Kira, had a vision of creating a space for pet lovers after their beloved llama, Gerald, accidentally launched himself into the neighbor's yard, becoming a local legend. Inspired by Gerald's boundless spirit (and surprising vertical leap), Kira decided it was time to celebrate all creatures great, small, and occasionally absurd.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2012, we gained momentum when our first-ever employee, a goldfish named Captain Bubbles, “made waves” by designing our original logo. While skeptics questioned the practicality of hiring a fish, Captain Bubbles had an eye for design unmatched by any human—literally, because he was working from a bowl.
                <br><br>            
                By 2015, PetPals was thriving, thanks in part to the efforts of Reginald, a particularly business-savvy emu. Reginald spearheaded our expansion into content creation, dictating marketing strategies via Morse code delivered through rhythmic pecking. It was unorthodox, but no one could deny his results.
                <br><br>
                The real turning point came in 2018, when we launched our “Squad Goals” campaign featuring our unlikely mascot: Steve, a charismatic axolotl. Steve's charm captivated audiences worldwide, and he quickly became the face of our platform, appearing on everything from T-shirts to motivational posters. (You haven't lived until you've read “Keep Swimming” in Comic Sans.)
                <br><br>
                Of course, there have been challenges. In 2021, a rogue herd of fainting goats—angry about our lack of goat-specific articles—stormed our headquarters. Negotiations were tense, but we reached an agreement after promising a monthly goat feature.
                <br><br>
                Today, PetPals stands as a beacon for all pet enthusiasts, no matter how unconventional their companions may be. Llamas, goldfish, emus, axolotls, fainting goats—we love them all, and we're here to celebrate the wonderfully weird world of pets.</p>
